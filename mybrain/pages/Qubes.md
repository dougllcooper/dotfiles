# Qubes

Seems to work OK.  Slow.  Everything is in vm's, so starting and stopping is slow. Based on older versions of fedora and Debian. Probably not going to get new software. Idea of qubes is nice. Different os's in different vm's, but in reality, it's more trouble and older, slower software for increased security which I don't really miss. Could harden nixos for more security.
