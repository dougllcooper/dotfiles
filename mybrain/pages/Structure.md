# Structure

Like some of the Beau Haan strategy
- use #inbox in journal for fleeting notes
- #fleeting is used for initial notes. Then go back and add your own comments and observations
- #literature is where you have a brief summary of each point in your own words to show that you understand each point
- once done each section, put a short summary on the same line as the # tag. When you collapse the section, the summary still shows.
- #reference section goes above this. Put link to source on same line as tag and metadata as child info below it. 
- reference section and notes below become your reference material for your permanent notes. 
- #permanent notes go above this level with notes being on a separate page and a short summary being the link to it.
