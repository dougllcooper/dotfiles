# Fedora Silverblue

Installs and runs fine. Takes a long time to startup and reboot. Not good considering everytime you do anything, you have to reboot.

Mostly based on docker, flatpak, toolbox, distrobox, etc. All tools that exist already. Rpm-ostree is only new tool. Basically it's the same linux as normal. Easier to deal with.

Apps running inside flatpaks can't access sdk's outside. This makes anything like development hard.
