# Languages as a hobby

1. Haskell. This is probably the language which will blow your mind the most. I’d also take a look at Simon Peyton-Jones’ classic book, The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages. It’s definitely not the state of the art, but everything in that book is still useful.
2. Scheme. By that, I mean working your way through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. If you’re interested in programming concepts, this is one of the best educations you’ll get.
3. Prolog. This is probably the second most mind-blowing language that you could learn. And once you’ve used Prolog for a bit, you’ll find Erlang that much easier.
4. Pharo.  An object-oriented language which uses a model that’s closer to the spirit of Alan Kay than what you find in the Simula family of languages. I would suggest Smalltalk, or possibly Newspeak. You may also find a language Eiffel or Sather interesting.
