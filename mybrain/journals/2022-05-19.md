- [[Linux]] [[Dotfiles Git Repo]]
	- Backup dotfiles with git and rcm
	- https://www.padok.fr/en/blog/backup-dotfiles-git-rcm
		- mkrc - bless a file as a dotfile managed by RCM
		- lsrc - list dotfiles managed by RCM
		- rcup - update and install dotfiles managed by RCM
		- rcdn - remove dotfiles managed by RCM
	- Bless a file means move it and create a symlink
		- Bless removes the dot to make them more visible
		- Simlink is normal name with the dot
	- Backup:
		- 1. Create empty private github repo
		  2. Clone it on your machine
		  3. use mkrc to add files to repo
	- Tried this out.  Lot of command line options for adding stuff to repo.
	- Adding directory doesn't symlink directory name but links all files
	- Restores correctly
