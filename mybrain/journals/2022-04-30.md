		- Logseq long form writing setup
		- Focus Mode - Select Page Properties, Line Highlight, and Hide Topbar to hide these things. Leads to a lot cleaner interface.  Focus mode fades out text except the paragraph you're working on.
		- Document mode - toggles off bulletpoint.  shortcut: t d will toggle document mode (command mode in vim mode).
			- Enter creates a new line in the same bullet. Shift + Enter creates a new bullet. (paragraph)
		- Hide Clutter with Custom CSS
			- Hide help button on lower right screen
				- Settings -> Edit custom.css
					- At bottom of file add:
					- .cp__sidebar-help-btn {
					- display: none;
					- }
		- Hide references at bottom of screen
			- Add to custom.css
			- .references.mt-6.flex-1.flex-row { /*hide linked and unlinked references*/
			    display: none;
			- }
		- Problem with these two things is that there don't seem to be an easy way to turn them on and off.
		- Not a big deal with the help button but don't want references turned off all the time
		- Next is themes.  Quattro and Bear themes work really well with this long form mode
		- Ctrl + C; Ctrl + B - hides double square brackets around links
		- Summary
			- Turn on focus mode
			- td - toggle document mode
			- Ctrl C; Ctrl B - toggle square brackets
