	- Wil T - Youtube - Nix Language Overview
		- Variables
			- are immutable
			- can only be set inside a let
			- a = 7;
			- b = 4.3;
			- c = "string";
			- d = ''multi
			        line string'';
		- Sets - Also called attribute sets
			- Enclosed in curly braces
			- Key value pair delimited by ;
			- c = { d = 7; f = "test"; g = { h = "sub"; j = "set"; }};
		- Lists
			- square brackets delimited by spaces
			- [1 2 3 4];
			- ["one" "two" "three" "four" ];
		- Functions
			- only have one argument
			- foo: foo + 1 - foo: is argument, foo + 1 is body
			- myfunc = foo: foo + 1;
			- set as argument
			- {a, b, c}: a + b + c;   - commas between arguments in set
		- Derivations
			- derivation {
			    system = "x86_64-linux";
			    name = "foo";
			    builder = ./builder.sh;
			    outputs = [ "out" ];
			  };
			- Call this function and it returns the derivation
			- You generally won't use derivation directly.
			- Better alternatives: mkDerivation, runCommand, writeScriptBin
		- Special Statements
			- With
				- environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
				    git
				    strace
				  ];
				- same as:
				- environment.systemPackages = [
				    pkgs.git
				    pkgs.strace
				  ];
			- Import
				- y = import ./myfile.nix
				- z = import ./myfolder  # load default.nix from myfolder
				- Anything you put in another file to import, drop the last semicolon in the file.
			- Inherit
				- inherit y;
				- same as saying y = y;
				- sets y to value y that was passed into function or set
			- IF
				- can't create function blocks - mostly used to set values
				- y = if x == 7 then "yes" else "no";   # y is "yes" or "no"
			- Let
				- my_func:
				    let
				      x = 7;
				      y = 8;
				    in {
				      result - could be set or list
				    };
				- The in block is what's returned. You can do calculations in the let portion if you don't want them included in the return set or list.
		- Repl
			- nix repl brings up a repl
				- don't need to have let blocks to use variables
				- variables can be redefined
				- don't use ; at end of lines
				- pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {} to import packages
		- Language Server
			- https://github.com/nix-community/rnix-lsp
				- supports:
					- vim (coc, lsp client, vim-lsp)
					- emacs (lsp-mode, eglot)
					- kakoune (kak-lsp)
					- vscode (vscode-nix-ide)
